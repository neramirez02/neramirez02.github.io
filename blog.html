        <p class= "red">
            Today, I had a CS50 lecture video from Harvard and my first impression of the video is the professor David Malan talks about different definitions
            of coding like Binary, Algorithms, pseudocode, and cryptography. The introduction to CS50 was amazing. it was like 2 minutes but it was amazing and
            very detailed. The lecture also had a demo where the binary code will turn on bulbs while having the correct number as well. There were also a picture
            that presented of what he talked about, which gives us a better picture of the concept. Binary was easy to understand because it is almost like math.
            There are a total number of 8 digits, using only 1's and 0's. It uses the number 2 as the base and numbers 0-8 for the exponent. The lowest number is 1 
            and the highest number is 128. When all the numbers are added up together, it will equal to 255. What was intriguing to me was the algorithms and how David made
            an example of a phone textbook. Algorithms is to solve problems step by step and cutting the problems in half until we get to our solution. When the video lecture
            was like two-thirds in, he talked about cyptography and I thought how are people able to encrypt and decrypt files. Did they use Python, HTML, or Java? I really don't
            the process of it and I would like to explore on that in order to understand it more. This video was very interesting for an introduction on how CS50 will be like and
            how the psets (problem sets) will be like each week. I'll talk about CS50 more when I watch the second lecture and dive in to the first pset. The pset will be
            something with Scratch and I wonder what I will create or build.

            Hello everybody, my purpose for this blog is to write out the challenges/problems I get from my Accelerated Computer Science elective (ACS) and to look back at the problems,
            which gives me the skill and experience for later on during college or job. I chose to be in ACS because I want to explore and learn more about Computer Science early 
            than being taught later on high school but I want to have the first experience of ACS so I know the skill already and apply it later on college or a job. What I hope that
            I can get out of this blog and elective is have the skill or experience early in life so I put this in my resume for a college or job. I also want to look back at this blog
            when Iâ€™m a Senior or a Freshmen in college to see how my elective was back then and to see my work I made as a Freshmen in High School.
        </p>

            In the picture to the right, we were given 
            <a href= "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18XG1NQzjgTt_I_1goRbgkczyNBsb37iIUM1r4ARBPaw/edit#slide=id.p">these instructions</a>
            to build the tallest balloon tower in 10 minutes. The only materials that we had was balloons and masking tape. We thought this was going to be a competition and there was two groups. My group had an idea
            of having the base 4 balloons and tape 2 balloons from their ends. We built off of the base and added 2 balloons each time. We kept repeating this process and our tower went to 57 inches in 10 minutes. When
            the time finished, the other group didn't made much progress at all and ended up falling off of the table. When we went back to the tables, we had a discussion about how things went well and 
            what things went wrong. When we were about to start another round, our teacher told us that he never said anything about competition or being in groups. We were all suprised and shocked 
            about that because our group was eager to create the tallest tower and never thought about working altogether. When the second round started, we all worked together to build off to the 57 inch tower but we only
            had 5 minutes to make it taller so we merged our two towers and added more balloons to the top. After 5 minutes, we made our tower to be 86 inches tall. We were all proud about our success and how we all worked
            together as a team. This was the first activity we had yet there are more other challenges that we need to do but working together we can finish any problem that we face each day of the elective.
            Well, that's all for today's blog post.
