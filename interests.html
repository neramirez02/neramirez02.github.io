            <p>
              Hey everyone, welcome to my page where I wrote things that are my interests and my favorite things. A couple of things I like and enjoy are video games, biking, and watching movies. Below, you will ready and see things that I enjoy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id= "video-games">Video Games</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              I love video games. The first handheld console I got was a Nintendo DS Lite with New Super Mario Bros., which I was like 6 years old. From there, I started to have a GameCube, PS3, GameBoy,
              3DS, and finally a Xbox One. I've been playing video games for 9 years and probably still continue to play games. It's really fun for me since I usually got bored when I was little and always did my homework quick and had so much time to spare.
              There are many games that I enjoyed playing but my two favorite games are <a id= "red" href="http://smashbros.com/us/">Super Smash Bros.</a> and <a id="blue" href= "https://www.fallout4.com">Fallout 4</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="red1">Super Smash Bros.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              I've had this game since when it first released. I played it non-stop for a week, getting all characters but also the trophies of the characters.
              My two favorite characters as I played in te game are <a id="toon-link">Toon Link</a> and <a id="little-mac">Little Mac</a>. I used both of them
              in the Smash Tournament of the AV Club from my high school and it brought me to the finals of the tournament. There was two brackets, one for the regular game and
              the other for the loser brackets, basically for them to redeem themselves. It's a really fun game when it comes to playing with friends or battling other people online,
              but mostly battling friends so you can talk smack in front of them and roast them. 
              
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 id="blue1">Fallout 4</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              I also got this game when it first released. It's a role-playing game where the game takes place in Boston and I can roam to any part of the game, whether if I'm doing 
              a <a id="pip-boy">quest</a> or not. In the game, I can also control the story, whether if I would like to do a quest or do a different quest. It's not like Call Of Duty or Metro Last Night
              that already make the story and have to complete it in that order. I can simply decide if I would like to take the quest or not, since I can go back to it. However, the decisions
              I take on main quests can drive the storyline to different things and might cancel out a different quest, since in the game there are factions. In the game, there
              is an extraordinary plot that takes in the future, where atomic bombs fell into cities and been survivors from the bombs. And the the thing that I mostly enjoy about to game is that
              I can kill and blow up people, animals, and creatures in many different ways, especially in V.A.T.S. since I could kill them in slow motion with all the blood spreading. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              When it comes to <a id="bike">biking</a>, I have a good time riding on the streets, feeling the breeze, and viewing many things as I pass by. One of the reasons that I like to bike is it keeps me active
              so that I won't be at home all day, doing nothing like being at my phone, watching tv, or playing video games. It's a good way to avoid technology for a couple of hours and be outside.
              Another reason I like to bike is I am able to test out my endurance, to see how far I could go until my thighs are hurting like hell and can't walk at all. The furthest I went to a place with
              a friend is going through Morgan Hill and arrive Girloy but also ride back to Morgan Hill. Check out the <a id="gilroy">map</a> to how far it is on bike. Finally, the last reason I like to bike ride
              is to travel to many places, seeing the stores and people as I pass by. Something that's fun for me is when there is traffic on a street and I just pass by on my bike like nothing. I just smile and laugh
              a bit inside. 
              
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="watching-movies">Watching Movies</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              I love going out to the theatres and watch movies with friends because it's fun and entertaining watching it but also being with friends at the same time. It's nice chilling with friends, everyone all together
              having a good time. Plus, after the movie, we can go out to walk around the mall. Anothing thing I love to go to the movies is because I can use it as an excuse to get out of other invitions. Sometimes, I have to go
              to places with my parents but I don't really want to go with them so mostly going to a friend's house or go to watch movies is the best option. The latest movie I've seen is <a id="x-men">X-Men: Apocalypse</a>, which 
              came out a week ago. It was exciting, interesting, but also funny in a couple of clips. The movie that I am going to see next for sure is Finding Dory, which will be interesting.
